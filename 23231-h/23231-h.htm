3</span>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, the rich merchant, to
his brother, who entered his counting-room one fine spring
morning.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am truly glad to see you&mdash;but what
has brought you to the city, at this <i>busy country</i> season,
when ploughing and planting are its life and sinews?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A motive,&rdquo; said Howard, smiling, &ldquo;that I am
sure will need no apology with you&mdash;<i>business</i>!&nbsp; I
have acquired a few hundreds, which I wish to invest safely, and
I want your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you say safely, I presume you mean to include
profitably.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 4--><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>&ldquo;Ay, profitably and safely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am just fitting out a ship for Canton; what do you
think of investing the sum in articles of foreign
merchandise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;I have great
distrust of winds and waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose you invest it in Eastern lands? many have made
fortunes in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not seeking to make a fortune,&rdquo; said Howard,
quietly;&mdash;&ldquo;my object is to secure something for my
family in case of accident, and I only want to invest what I do
not require for present use in a manner that will bring compound
interest.&nbsp; I hope not to be obliged to take up the interest
for many years, but to be adding it to the principal, with such
sums as I may be able to spare from our daily
exertions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive, brother,&rdquo; replied Mr. Draper, a
little scornfully, &ldquo;you have not increased in worldly
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been much in the way of it,&rdquo; said
Howard.&mdash;&ldquo;Mine is a still, peaceful life&mdash;I study
the changes of the atmosphere more than the science of worldly
wisdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 5--><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>&ldquo;We can get along, however, but poorly without
it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Draper; &ldquo;the harmlessness of the
dove is no match for the cunning of the serpent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Howard; &ldquo;but if you mean me by
the dove, there is no necessity for my venturing into the nest of
serpents.&nbsp; I am well aware that my habits of thinking and
modes of life are tame and dull, compared to your projects and
success;&mdash;but we are differently constituted, and while I
honor your spirit and enterprise, and do justice to the honest
and intelligent business men of your city, I am contented with my
own lot, which is that of a farmer, whose object is to earn a
competency from his native soil, or, in other words, from
ploughing and planting.&nbsp; I have no desire for speculation,
no courage for it; neither do I think, with a family like mine, I
have a right to <i>risk</i> my property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are wrong; every body has a right to do as he
pleases with his own property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be honest, then,&rdquo; replied Howard, &ldquo;I
have none that I call exclusively my own.&nbsp; <!-- page 6--><a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Property is
given to us for the benefit of others; every man is accountable
for his stewardship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you do better than to double and treble it
every year, or, by some fortunate speculation, convert ten
thousand dollars into ten times ten thousand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say,&rdquo; replied Howard, &ldquo;if this
were a certainty, it would cease to be <i>speculation</i>, and I
should feel bound to do it, within honest means.&nbsp; But as the
guardian of my family, I feel that I have no right to venture my
little capital in a lottery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lucky all men are not of your mind,&rdquo; said
Mr. Draper, rather impatiently, and taking up his pen, which he
had laid down;&mdash;&ldquo;but really, brother, I am full of
engagements, and though I am rejoiced to see you, I must defer
further conversation till we meet at dinner; then we shall have
time to talk over your affairs; just now, I am wholly
engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the dinner hour Howard went to his brother&rsquo;s
house.&nbsp; It was large, and elegantly furnished, and, what in
the city is rather uncommon, surrounded by trees and
pleasure-grounds, <!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>a fine yard in front, and a large
garden in the rear.&nbsp; Mr. Draper purchased the place when
real estate was low, and it had since risen to more than double
its original value.&nbsp; Howard was conducted to the
dining-room, where he found his sister-in-law, Mrs. Draper.&nbsp;
They met with much cordiality&mdash;but he perceived that she was
thinner and paler than when they last met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not well, I fear,&rdquo; said Howard,
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a cold,&rdquo; replied she; and with that
nervous affection which often follows inquiries after the health,
she gave a half-suppressed cough.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you seen my
husband?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I left the stage at the corner of State Street,
and went directly to his counting-room; but I found him engrossed
by business, and verily believe I should not have obtained a
moment&rsquo;s conversation after the brotherly welcome that his
heart gave me in spite of teas, silks, hides, stocks, and per
centage, if I had not had a little business of my own,&mdash;a
little money to invest.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>&ldquo;Are you, too, growing rich?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Draper, with a languid smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; replied Howard; &ldquo;we farmers have not
much prospect of growing <i>rich</i>.&nbsp; If we earn a
comfortable living, and lay by a little at the end of the year,
we call ourselves thriving, and that is the most we can
expect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have advantages,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper,
&ldquo;that do not belong to those who are striving to grow rich;
you have wealth that money seldom can
buy,&mdash;<i>time</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have our seasons of leisure,&rdquo; returned Howard,
&ldquo;and yet, I assure you, we have employment enough to prize
those periods.&nbsp; You would be surprised to find how much
constant occupation every season demands.&nbsp; Spring is the
great storehouse of our wealth, but we must toil to open its
treasures; they are hid in the bowels of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper, &ldquo;of the
story of the farmer who had two sons.&nbsp; To one he left a
large sum of gold; to the other his farm, informing him he would
find an equivalent portion hid in the earth.&nbsp; The one
invested his money in merchandise, and <!-- page 9--><a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>made
&lsquo;haste to grow rich;&rsquo; the other dug every year with
renewed hope of finding the gold, and continued planting and
sowing as his father had done before him.&nbsp; At the end of
fifteen years, they met on the same spot, the one a bankrupt, the
other a thriving farmer.&nbsp; I suppose,&rdquo; added she,
&ldquo;I need not put the moral to the end of my tale, in
imitation of &AElig;sop&rsquo;s fables; you will find it
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so applicable,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;to our
present conversation, that I almost think it is an impromptu for
my benefit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for yours,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you do not want
it.&nbsp; But now tell me a little about your fanning
seasons.&nbsp; Spring, I understand, must be a very busy one; but
when you have ploughed and planted, what have you to do but sit
down and wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sister,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;you, who
know so much better than I do how to carry out your comparisons,
can well understand that there is no time given us for idleness;
while we wait the result of one part of our labors, we have other
works to accomplish.&nbsp; Spring-time and harvest follow each
other rapidly; <!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>we have to prepare our barns and
granaries.&nbsp; Our mowing season is always one of our
busiest.&nbsp; We have our anxieties, too;&mdash;we watch the
clouds as they pass over us, and our spirits depend much on
sunshine and rain; for an unexpected shower may destroy all our
labors.&nbsp; When the grass is cut, we must make it into hay;
and, when it is properly prepared, store it in the barns.&nbsp;
After haying-time, there are usually roads, fences, and stone
walls to repair, apples to gather in, and butter to pack
down.&nbsp; Though autumn has come, and the harvest is gathered
in, you must not suppose our ploughing is over.&nbsp; We turn up
the ground, and leave it rough, as a preparation for the
spring.&nbsp; A good farmer never allows the winter to take him
by surprise.&nbsp; The cellars are to be banked up, the barns to
be tightened, the cattle looked to,&mdash;the apples carefully
barrelled, and the produce sent to market.&nbsp; We have long
evenings for assorting our seeds, and for fireside
enjoyment.&nbsp; Winter is the season for adjusting the accounts
of the past year, and finding out whether we <!-- page 11--><a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>are thriving
farmers.&nbsp; Depend upon it, we have no idle time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How curiously we may follow out the cultivation of the
earth with the striking analogy it bears to the human
mind,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper, &ldquo;in sowing the seeds, in
carefully plucking up the weeds without disturbing what ought to
be preserved, in doing all we can by our own labors, and trusting
to Heaven for a blessing on our endeavors!&nbsp; A reflecting
farmer must be a wise man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;there are not
many wise men amongst us, according to your estimation.&nbsp; In
all employments we find hurry and engrossment; we do not stop to
reason and meditate; many good agricultural men are as destitute
of moral reflection as the soil they cultivate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper, &ldquo;they have not
the same temptation to become absorbed by business as
merchants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we shall find human nature much the same in
all situations,&rdquo; said Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is one
great advantage, however, in farming&mdash;that is, its
comparative security:&mdash;we are satisfied <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>with moderate
gains; we have none of those tremendous anxieties that come with
sudden failures, the fall of stocks, and obstructed
currency.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this is every thing,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper, with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody knows better than I do, how a
noble and cultivated mind may be subjugated by the feverish
pursuit of wealth&mdash;how little time can be spared to the
tranquil pleasures of domestic life, to the home of early
affection&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped, and seemed
embarrassed.&mdash;Howard&rsquo;s color rose high; there was a
pause.&nbsp; At length he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every situation has its trials; those who best support
them are the happiest.&nbsp; But we are growing serious.&nbsp; I
want to see your children&mdash;how they compare with mine in
health and size, and whether we can build any theory in favor of
a country life in this respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The children were brought; they were both girls.&nbsp; The
eldest was the picture of health, but the youngest seemed to have
inherited something of the delicacy of her mother&rsquo;s
constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can scarcely show one amongst my boys,&rdquo; <!--
page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>said Howard, &ldquo;that gives evidence of more ruddy
health than your eldest girl, Frances; but my wife&rsquo;s little
namesake, Charlotte, looks more like a city-bred lady.&mdash;O,
here comes my brother James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Draper entered.&nbsp; A close observer would have been
struck with the difference of expression in the countenances of
the two brothers, although they were marked by a strong
resemblance.&nbsp; That of the eldest was eager and flushed; the
brightness of his eye was not dimmed, but it was unsettled and
flashing; there were many lines of care and anxiety, and his
whole air marked him as a business man.&nbsp; Howard&rsquo;s
exterior was calm, and thoughtful;&mdash;the very hue of his
sun-burnt complexion seemed to speak of the healthy influence of
an out-of-door atmosphere.&nbsp; They were both men of education
and talent; but circumstances early in life rendered them for a
time less united.&nbsp; Both had fixed their affections on the
gentle being before them.&nbsp; James was the successful
suitor.&nbsp; There are often wonderful proofs of St.
Pierre&rsquo;s proposition that &lsquo;harmony proceeds from
contrast.&rsquo;&nbsp; Frances and Howard had much <!-- page
14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>the
same tastes and pursuits.&nbsp; Howard&rsquo;s attachment was
deep and silent; James&rsquo;s, ardent and zealously
expressed;&mdash;he won the prize.&nbsp; Howard&rsquo;s taste led
him to a country life.&nbsp; He was not rich enough to become a
gentleman farmer; he therefore became a working one.&nbsp; For
years, he did not visit his brother; but at length the wound was
entirely healed by another of the fair creatures whom Heaven has
destined to become the happiness or misery of man.&nbsp; Still
the theory of contrast was carried through; his second love was
unlike his first; she was full of gayety and life, and gave to
his mind an active impulse, which it often wanted.&nbsp; Frances,
in the midst of society, drew her most congenial pleasures from
books.&nbsp; Charlotte, the wife of Howard, though in comparative
solitude, drew her enjoyment from society.&nbsp; There was not a
family in the village near, that did not, in some way or other,
promote her happiness.&nbsp; Her information was gathered from
intercourse with living beings&mdash;her knowledge from real
life.&nbsp; If the two sisters had changed situations, the one
might have become a mere bookworm; the other, from the liveliness
<!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>of her disposition, and the warm interest she took in
characters, a little of a gossip.&nbsp; As it was, they both
admirably filled their sphere in life, and influenced and were
influenced by the characters of their partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not persuade Charlotte to come with
you?&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sisters ought to be
better acquainted than we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I invited her,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;but she
laughed at my proposing that a farmer and his wife should leave
the country at the same time.&nbsp; I have brought, however, a
proposal from her, that you should transport yourself and
children back with me; we have room enough in our barn-like house
for any of your attendants that you wish to bring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment Mrs. Draper seemed disposed to accept the
invitation; but she immediately added,&mdash;&ldquo;I do not like
to take my children from their schools.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just the answer Charlotte anticipated, and she
desired me to combat it with all my book-learning opposed to
yours, and now and then fill up the interstices with such plain
matter-of-fact argument as she could offer; for <!-- page 16--><a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>instance,
that they would improve more in one month passed in the country,
at this fine season, than in a whole summer at school.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Tell her,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;to let them</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Leave their books and come away,<br />
That boys and girls may join in play.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I really think, Frances,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper,
&ldquo;this would be an excellent plan; you are not quite well,
and the country air will be of service to you and
Charlotte.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have so much more of country round us,&rdquo; said
she, with an air of satisfaction, &ldquo;than most of my city
friends, that I scarcely feel it right to make trees or grass an
excuse for emigration.&nbsp; I have as much pleasure in seeing
spring return to unlock my treasures, as you can have,
Howard.&nbsp; I must show you some of my rare plants.&nbsp; I
have, too, my grape and strawberry vines; and finer peach trees I
do not think you can exhibit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sincerely hope,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;you will
enjoy this pleasure long, and eat fruit that you have cultivated
yourself: I dare say, it is sweeter than any you can
buy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>&ldquo;It ought to be,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, a little
seriously, &ldquo;for it certainly costs about six times as much
as the highest market price that we should pay.&nbsp; We live
here at a most enormous rent; my conscience often twinges me on
the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet I have heard you say, that you bought this
place lower,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;than any which you would
now occupy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true; but by taking down this building, and
cutting the land into lots, I might get a house
clear.&rdquo;&nbsp; A slight flush passed over Mrs.
Draper&rsquo;s cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had applications,&rdquo; continued Mr. Draper,
&ldquo;for the whole estate as it stands; but really, it is such
a source of pleasure to my wife to have her garden and her
shrubbery, that I have not listened to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doubtful, however, whether I am doing right to let
so much property remain idle and useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not useless, brother,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;if it
gives so much enjoyment to your family.&nbsp; What can you do
with money but purchase <!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>happiness in some form or
other?&nbsp; The benevolent purchase it by relieving the wants of
others, and are blessed in blessing; nor can I see why money may
not as wisely be expended in the purchase of a fine house and
garden, as by investing it in stocks, or ships and
cargoes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply because the one is dead property, and brings no
interest; the other is constantly accumulating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no such thing as being <span
class="smcap">rich enough</span>?&rdquo; said Howard.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are we to be always striving to acquire, and never sitting
quietly down to enjoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can look forward to that time more earnestly
than I do,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every wise man
will fix upon a certain sum, that his reason and experience tell
him will be sufficient for his expenditures; and then he ought to
retire from business, and hazard no more.&mdash;Now, Howard, as I
must hurry through dinner, we may as well improve our time.&nbsp;
I promised to aid you in the disposition of your surplus
money.&nbsp; As you have a dread of adventure, and do not like to
run any risk, I <!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>will take it myself, and give you
compound interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard expressed his thanks.&nbsp; &ldquo;You owe me none; it
will be a matter of convenience to me to have the use of this
additional money.&nbsp; I only feel some compunction in deriving
that profit from it which you might yourself reap.&nbsp; However,
as I take the risk, and you take none, it is according to your
own plan;&mdash;and now I must be off; I have already overrun my
time,&rdquo; said he, looking at his watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
possible, I shall be at home early, but it is a busy season; two
East India cargoes have just arrived, and several consignments of
cotton from the south; all are pressing upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said Howard, as he disappeared,
&ldquo;is the same active, enterprising man he always was.&nbsp;
I rejoice to hear, however, that he has set some limits to his
desire for wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our desires grow proportionably to our increase of
wealth, I believe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper.&nbsp; &ldquo;When we
began life, your brother said, if he was ever worth a hundred
thousand dollars, <!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>he would retire from business; he now
allows himself to be worth much more than that amount, and yet
you perceive our homestead becomes too valuable for our own use,
because it can be converted to money.&nbsp; All this, however,
would be nothing, if I did not see this eager pursuit of gain
robbing him of the pleasures of domestic life, of the recreation
every father ought to allow himself to receive from the innocent
conversation and sports of his children.&nbsp; He cannot spare
time for travel&mdash;to become acquainted with the beautiful
views of our own country.&nbsp; To you, who knew him, as I did,
full of high and noble perceptions, this is a melancholy
change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard was silent; he remembered his brother&rsquo;s early
restless desire of wealth, strikingly contrasted with his own
indifference to it.&nbsp; Frances judged of his character by that
period of life when all that is imaginative or sentimental is
called into action;&mdash;she judged him by the season of
<i>first love</i>.&nbsp; She little supposed that the man who was
contented to ramble with her over hill and dale, who could bathe
in moonbeams, and talk of the dewy breath <!-- page 21--><a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of evening
and morning, as if it came from &ldquo;Araby the blest,&rdquo;
would one day refuse to quit the bustle of State Street, or the
dark, noisy lumber of India Wharf, to gaze on the Falls of
Niagara, because it could not thunder money in his ear! that his
excursions were to be confined to manufactories, coal-mines,
rail-road meetings, and Eastern lands.&nbsp; This development of
character had been gradual, and she scarcely realized his entire
devotion to business, till she saw his health affected by that
scourge of our &ldquo;pleasant vices,&rdquo; dyspepsy.&nbsp; She
expressed her apprehensions to Howard, and begged him to use all
his influence to break the spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can think of nothing that will have more
effect,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;than for you to accept my
wife&rsquo;s invitation, to pass a few weeks with us in the
country.&nbsp; This will occasionally withdraw my brother from
the city, and it appears to me that your own health may be
benefited by the change.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was struck with his
sister&rsquo;s altered appearance, with the occasional flush, the
short, low cough; yet she said she was well&mdash;&ldquo;only a
slight cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>At length she promised to be with them the ensuing week,
provided her husband could make arrangements to go with
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he knows that I depend on him,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;it will be the strongest inducement for him to quit
the city for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Draper returned late in the evening, and had only time to
complete his business affairs with his brother, who departed
early the next morning.</p>
<h2><!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p>The spring had returned with its new-born beauty, its swelling
buds, it tender grass; here and there a tree in the city
anticipated the season of leaves, and put forth its verdant
honors.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Lucy, who had
long been a faithful domestic in the family, &ldquo;if you are
going particular, and don&rsquo;t expose yourself by going into
the garden, and will take the cough-drops regularly, morning and
evening, you will get rid of your cold.&nbsp; This is just the
season when every body gets well that got sick as you
did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; said Mrs. Draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when the sap was going down the trees in the
autumn; but now it is going up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But whether the sap had already gone up, or for some other
reason, which was as clear to human perception, Francis did not
shake off her wearing cough.&nbsp; Mr. Draper was not alarmed at
it; it was very unobtruding, and he <!-- page 24--><a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>had become
<i>used to it</i>.&nbsp; It was not one of those vulgar, hoarse
coughs, that, till we connect danger with it, often excites
indignation in those who are listening to an interesting
narrative, or to a reader, who is obliged to wait till the
impertinent paroxysm is over.&nbsp; Mrs. Draper&rsquo;s was quite
a lady-like cough, low and gentle, and seemed rather like impeded
respiration.</p>
<p>Visiters would sometimes observe, when they went away,
&ldquo;Mrs. Draper is still a handsome woman, though she has lost
her bloom.&nbsp; What a pity she has that affected little cough!
it really spoils her; it is nothing but a habit; she could easily
break herself of it, if any body would be honest enough to tell
her.&rdquo;&nbsp; This task rested with Lucy alone; but it was
all in vain.&nbsp; Frances took the cough-drops morning and
evening, and still the disagreeable habit remained.&nbsp; Mr.
Draper was very little at home; and when he was, his mind was
engaged by new projects.&nbsp; Anxiety, however, did not rob him
of sleep: he was too successful; he seemed to have the Midas-like
art of turning every thing to gold:&mdash;his thousands were
rapidly accumulating, and half a million was now the <!-- page
25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>point
at which he determined to stop.&nbsp; Mrs. Draper&rsquo;s slight
cough did not attract his attention; but if her appetite failed,
he grew anxious, and feared she was not well.</p>
<p>Week after week passed, and still it was impossible for Mr.
Draper to leave the city.&nbsp; At length, a letter arrived from
Charlotte, claiming the visit; and he substituted one of his
clerks to conduct his family to his brother&rsquo;s
residence.&nbsp; Here, though not more than forty miles from the
city, Mrs. Draper found the freshness and novelty of country
life.&nbsp; The family were farmers, children and all.&nbsp;
Charlotte was acquainted with all the little details belonging to
a farm, and took as much interest as her husband did in the
growth of grain, the raising of pigs and poultry, and feeding
cattle in the best and most economical manner.&nbsp; She
displayed her dairy with its cheese arranged on shelves, her
white pans of milk, and her newly-churned butter, which
impregnated the air with its sweetness.</p>
<p>It was with long-forgotten feelings of health that Frances
breathed the atmosphere around her; she perceived that her
respiration was <!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>more free.&nbsp; &ldquo;How ignorant
I was,&rdquo; said she to Howard, &ldquo;to compare my city
garden to the country!&nbsp; There is music in every accidental
sound.&nbsp; How fresh is the air! how unlike the mornings to
which I have been accustomed, where the voice of the teamster
urging on his over-loaded horse, or the monotonous cry of the
fishmonger, disturbed my slumbers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her heart beat with pleasure as she saw her children go forth
with their cousins to rural enjoyments: her tender bud, which she
had often feared would never live to unfold its beauty, her
little Charlotte, she saw here as joyous and as active as her
sister.&nbsp; New hopes and anticipations brightened the
future.&nbsp; How does returning health change the prospect of
external circumstances!&nbsp; The cough was much less constant,
and Charlotte, who professed to have wonderful skill in curing
diseases, had undertaken to eradicate it.&nbsp; She did not
approve of late slumbers, and every morning she brought her
patient a tumbler of new milk, and challenged her to come out and
breathe the fresh air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not wait,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;till its wings are clogged by the smoke of the city; <!--
page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>come and win an appetite for our country breakfast, our
new-laid eggs: the children are hunting for them amongst the hay,
and here comes my little namesake with her prize: she has brought
hers for your breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Draper did not arrive at the time he appointed, and
Frances often felt the sickness of hope delayed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Deliver me from such excellent husbands,&rdquo; said
Charlotte to Howard, &ldquo;who are wasting the best years of
their lives in acquiring wealth for their families, and yet never
think themselves <i>rich enough</i>.&nbsp; Here is poor Frances,
kept in a state of feverish anxiety, when rest and tranquillity
are absolutely necessary for the restoration of her
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Saturday evening following, Mr. Draper arrived.&nbsp; He
was delighted to see his wife and children, and thought they
looked remarkably well.&nbsp; On Sunday morning, he walked with
his brother over the farm, and calculated the probable receipts
of the year.&nbsp; Away from the atmosphere of business, his mind
seemed to recover its former freshness.&nbsp; &ldquo;How
beautiful this stillness is!&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;it reminds me
of <!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>the mythology of the heathen world; the ancients used to
say that when Pan slept, all nature held its breath, lest it
should awake him.&nbsp; You have made an enthusiast of Frances;
nothing will do for her now but the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife is anxious about the health of yours,&rdquo;
said Howard; &ldquo;she thinks her cough an indication of weak
lungs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, stopping short,
&ldquo;she is subject to a cough; ours is a miserable climate; I
hope the warm weather will entirely banish it.&nbsp; I have a bad
cough myself;&rdquo;&mdash;and he coughed with energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish, brother,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;that period
had arrived, at which you have so long been aiming, that you
thought yourself <i>rich enough</i> to devote more time to your
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one can look forward to it more eagerly than I
do,&rdquo; replied Mr. Draper; &ldquo;but you can little
understand the difficulty of withdrawing from business.&nbsp;
However, I fully mean to do it, when I have secured to my wife
and children an inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Howard smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, in reply to the smile, <!--
page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>&ldquo;you must not suppose my wants can be measured by
yours.&nbsp; Your farm supplies you with the materials of life,
and you get them at a cheap rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give for them what you give,&rdquo; said Howard,
&ldquo;time,&mdash;and a little more,&mdash;I give manual labor;
you know I belong to the working class.&nbsp; In this
money-making day, men despise small gains, and yet my own
experience tells me they are sufficient for happiness.&nbsp;
Great wealth can add but little to our enjoyments; domestic
happiness, you will allow, is cheaply bought, as far as money is
concerned, and riches cannot add a great deal to our corporeal
enjoyment.&nbsp; The pleasures of sense are wisely limited to
narrow boundaries; the epicure has no prolonged gratification in
eating; though he may wish for the throat of the crane, he cannot
obtain it; neither does he enjoy his expensive delicacies more
than the day-laborer does his simple fare.&nbsp; Of all the
sources of happiness in this world, overgrown wealth has the
least that is real; and from my own observation, I should think
it the most unproductive source of satisfaction to the
possessor.&nbsp; I have heard of many very <!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>wealthy men
that have tormented themselves with the fear of coming to actual
want, but I never heard of one man in moderate circumstances that
was afflicted with this monomania.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk like a philosopher,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper,
laughing, &ldquo;who means to live all his life in his tub.&nbsp;
However, I assure you that I do not intend always to pursue this
course of hurry and business; in a very short time, I expect to
agree with you that I am <i>rich enough</i>; now, my only desire
is to hasten that period, that I may devote myself to my
family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;that this
incessant toil is to purchase a blessing which is already within
your grasp!&nbsp; At least I hope you mean to devote yourself to
your family now, for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret to say,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, &ldquo;that I
must be off early to-morrow morning.&nbsp; But I am thinking, as
my wife and children enjoy the country so much, that it is an
object for me to purchase a snug little place where <!-- page
31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>they
may pass the summer.&nbsp; Do you know of any such near
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clyde Farm is up for sale,&rdquo; replied Howard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to ride over and see it,&rdquo; said Mr.
Draper, musing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not this morning,&rdquo; said Howard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon, then, will do as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Howard; &ldquo;this is the only
uninterrupted day I have with my family, and it is our regular
habit to attend public worship.&nbsp; To-morrow morning we will
ride over as early as you please, but to-day I hope you will
accept as a day of rest from business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Draper had thought it quite impossible to give a part of
the next morning to his family, but he always found time for
business.&nbsp; Accordingly, when the morning arrived, they rode
over to Clyde Farm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember that farm perfectly well,&rdquo; said Mr.
Draper; &ldquo;it was my favorite resort when I was a
boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember those times too,&rdquo; replied Howard,
&ldquo;when I used to lie stretched at full length by the side of
the waterfall, getting my <!-- page 32--><a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span><i>amo,
amas</i>, and only now and then roused by the distant sound of
your gun, which put all the little birds to flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it still that fine run of water?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely the same,&rdquo; replied Howard; &ldquo;this
very stream that flows through my pasture, and sparkles in the
morning sun, comes from old Clyde.&nbsp; Look this way, and see
what a leap it takes over those rocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clyde Farm was just such a spot as a romantic, visionary mind
might choose for its vagaries,&mdash;such a spot as an elevated,
contemplative one might select for its aspirations after higher
hopes, which seldom come in the tumult of life.&nbsp; Mr. Draper
felt at once that the place was congenial to the taste and habits
of his wife; it awoke in his own mind the recollection of his
boyish days, and from these he naturally reverted to the days of
courtship, when he talked of scenery and prospect as eloquently
as Frances.&nbsp; With a light step he followed his brother along
the stream that came leaping and bounding from the hills, till
they arrived at the still little lake whence it took its <!--
page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>course.&nbsp; The mists of the morning had dispersed,
and the blue sky and white clouds were reflected from its glassy
surface, while on its borders the deep, dark foliage of the woods
lay inverted.&nbsp; Both of the brothers stood silent when they
reached the edge of the water; both were impressed with the
beauty of the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How delighted Frances would be with this spot!&rdquo;
said Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is like the calm, tranquil mirror of
her own mind, which seems formed to reflect only the upper world,
with its glorious firmament.&nbsp; I think we have before us two
excellent prototypes of our wives:&mdash;while the clear,
peaceful lake represents yours, this happy, joyous, busy little
stream may be likened to my Charlotte, who goes on her way
rejoicing, and diffusing life and animation wherever she bends
her course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish Frances had a little more of her gayety,&rdquo;
said Mr. Draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;they will
operate favorably on each other.&nbsp; I perceive already a
mingling of character.&nbsp; I will venture to predict, Charlotte
will have a boat <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>with its gay streamers winding the
shore before long, and persuade her sister to become the
&lsquo;Lady of the Lake.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The matter was soon decided; the sisters visited the place,
and were enchanted with it; and Howard was authorized by his
brother to make the purchase.</p>
<p>The house had been built many years.&nbsp; It was irregular in
its form, and certainly belonged to no particular order of
architecture.&nbsp; There was a large dining-room, and doors that
opened upon the green, and plenty of small rooms; in short, it
was just such a house as Frances fancied; it was picturesque, and
looked, she said, &ldquo;as if it had grown and shot out here and
there like the old oaks around it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlotte begged that on herself might devolve the care of
furnishing it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know better than you,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;what will save trouble.&nbsp; Banish brass and
mahogany; admit nothing that requires daily labor to make it fine
and showy.&nbsp; I do not despair of setting you up a dairy, and
teaching you to churn your own butter.&rdquo;&nbsp; She truly
loved and honored her sister-in-law, and trembled for her life,
which <!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>she was persuaded she held by a frail
tenure.&nbsp; She was eager to prevent her returning to the city
during the warm season, and readily undertook to go herself and
make all necessary arrangements.&nbsp; Frances furnished her with
a list, and left much discretionary power to her agent.</p>
<p>In the course of a few days she returned.&mdash;&ldquo;We must
be at Clyde Farm to-morrow,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;to receive
the goods and chattels of which I am only the precursor.&nbsp;
Your husband enters warmly into the furnishing of your country
residence, and therefore we must let him have a voice in
it.&nbsp; His taste is not so simple as ours, so we must admit
some of the finery of the town house; pier and chimney glasses
are to be sent from it.&nbsp; I did not make much opposition to
this, for they will not only reflect our rustic figures within,
but the trees and grass without.&nbsp; How I long to have
haying-time come!&nbsp; You must ride from the fields with your
children, as I do, on a load of hay, when the work of the day is
over, and look down upon all the world.&nbsp; O Frances,&rdquo;
added <!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>she, &ldquo;if we could only persuade
your husband to turn farmer, our victory would be
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will never be,&rdquo; said Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that,&rdquo; replied Charlotte;
&ldquo;he seemed to set very little value on the city residence,
and would fain have stripped his elegant rooms to dignify your
rustic retreat; but I would not consent to the migration of a
particle of gilding or damask, but told him he might send the
marble slabs, with the mirrors,&mdash;and I speak for one of the
slabs for the dairy.&nbsp; But I have been more thoughtful for
you than you have for yourself: look at this list of books that I
have ordered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances was surprised; she had never seen Charlotte with a
book in her hand, and she candidly expressed her astonishment
that, amidst all her hurry, she had remembered <i>books</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think I acquired all my knowledge,&rdquo;
said Charlotte, &ldquo;if I never open a book?&nbsp; But you are
half right; I certainly do not patronize book-making; and yet all
summer I am reading the book of Nature.&nbsp; I open it with the
first snow-drop and crocus which peeps <!-- page 37--><a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>from under
her white robe; and then, when she puts on her green mantle,
strewed with</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The yellow cowslip and the pale
primrose,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I study the lilies of the field.&nbsp; Depend upon it, there
is more wisdom without doors than we can find within,&mdash;more
wisdom there than in books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe it,&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;all nature
speaks of the Creator,&mdash;of the one great Mind which formed
this endless variety, and can give life to the most insignificant
flower that grows by the way-side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what flower you call
insignificant,&rdquo; said Charlotte; &ldquo;not this little
houstonia, I hope; that has a perfection of organization in which
many of your splendid green-house flowers are deficient.&nbsp;
But that is the way with us: we call those things sublime which
are on a large scale, because they are magnified to our narrow
minds, and we can comprehend them without any trouble.&mdash;But
I must not display all my wisdom to you at once&mdash;how, like
Solomon of old, I can speak of trees, from &lsquo;the cedar-tree
that is in Lebanon <!-- page 38--><a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>even unto the hyssop that springeth
out of the wall.&rsquo;&mdash;And now, fair sister,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Up, up, and quit your books,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and come with me to one of my studios&mdash;namely, my
poultry-yard.&nbsp; I hear the bipeds clamorous for their
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the woman,&rdquo; thought Frances, &ldquo;that
I have sometimes wondered Howard, with his reflecting mind, could
select as his partner for life!&nbsp; Because I saw her, like the
Deity she worships, attending to the most minute affairs, I
foolishly imagined she comprehended no others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time the two sisters resembled in union
Shakspeare&rsquo;s twin cherries growing on one stem.</p>
<h2><!-- page 39--><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>The furniture arrived, and the country residence was very soon
in order.&nbsp; Howard took the direction of the farming
part.&nbsp; But it was no object to Frances to have much
ploughing or planting.&nbsp; She loved the &ldquo;green pastures
and still waters,&rdquo; and often repeated those beautiful lines
of the hymn&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To dewy vales and flowery meads,<br />
My weary, fainting steps he leads,<br />
Where peaceful rivers, soft and slow,<br />
Amid the verdant landscape flow.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clyde Farm was a singularly retired spot, notwithstanding its
vicinity to a country village, which, on a straight line, was
about two miles from it.&nbsp; But there was a high hill between,
that belonged to the farm, and was crowned with oak and chestnut
trees; while here and there was an opening which gave a perfect
view of the village, with its church, academy, and square
four-story tavern, with windows <!-- page 40--><a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>enough to
give it the appearance of a huge lantern.&nbsp; The high road was
a mile from the house, and no dwelling was nearer.&nbsp; The hill
overlooked one of those New England landscapes that could not be
wrought into a well-composed picture; objects were too abundant;
it was dotted with farms and sheets of water; and beyond, the
beautiful Merrimac wound its way.&nbsp; On this spot, Frances had
a little open pavilion erected, and it was her resort at
sunset.&nbsp; As her health improved, her mind opened to the
impressions of happiness, and she grew almost gay.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is but one thing more,&rdquo; said she to her
brother and sister, &ldquo;that I now desire in this
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always one thing wanting for us poor mortals!&rdquo;
said Charlotte; &ldquo;but let us hear what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That my husband, who is the liberal donor of my
enjoyment, should partake of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray be contented,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;and let
him enjoy himself in his own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a letter for you,&rdquo; said Howard,
&ldquo;that came enclosed in one to me;&rdquo; and, with an air
of hesitation, he gave it to her.</p>
<p><!-- page 41--><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>Frances hastily took it; her color came and went as she
read.&nbsp; It informed her, that the offers her husband had
received for his estate in town had not only opened his eyes to
its value, but had convinced him that, as a patriotic citizen, he
had no right to retain it for his private use; he had therefore
come to the conclusion to reap the benefit himself which other
speculators had proposed to do.&nbsp; He should take down the
house, make a street through the land, divide it into small lots,
and erect a number of houses upon it, one of which he meant to
reserve for himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should regret what I conceive
to be the necessity of this thing,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you
were not so perfectly satisfied with your Clyde residence.&nbsp;
As you will always repair to it early in the spring, it matters
little if you return to walls of brick and mortar in the
autumn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We pass over the involuntary tears that followed this
communication, as speculators would pronounce them
unreasonable.&nbsp; It now became necessary for Frances to visit
the city to make arrangements, and take a last leave of her
pleasant mansion.&nbsp; In justice, it must be <!-- page 42--><a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>said, she
thought less of her own deprivation than of the new accession of
care and toil that her husband was bringing upon
himself.&mdash;When she returned to Clyde, she had lost by
fatigue nearly all the health she had previously gained.</p>
<p>Most people have witnessed the rapidity with which the work of
destruction goes on in modern days.&nbsp; In a very short time
the splendid mansion was a pile of ruins, a street laid open, and
buildings erecting on the spot.</p>
<p>Mr. Draper&rsquo;s visits to Clyde had been hitherto confined
to the Sabbath, and generally terminated with it: but he now
wrote to his wife that he intended to &ldquo;pass a month with
her.&nbsp; It was a comparative season of leisure; his vessels
had sailed, his buildings were going on well, and he should be
able to enjoy the quiet of the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frances received this intelligence with new-born hope.&nbsp;
She felt certain, that one month, passed amidst the tranquil
pleasures of the country, would regenerate his early
tastes.&nbsp; She talked eloquently of the corrupting atmosphere
of the city, and was sanguine that now all would go well; that
his inordinate engrossment in <!-- page 43--><a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>business
would yield to the influences by which he would find himself
surrounded.&nbsp; And so it turned out, for a few days.&nbsp; Mr.
Draper was as happy as an affectionate husband and father must
naturally be, reunited to the objects of his tenderness.&nbsp; He
said that &ldquo;he felt uncommonly well, had much less of the
dyspepsy than he had experienced for years,&rdquo; followed his
little girls to their favorite haunts, and seemed to realize the
blessing of leisure.&nbsp; Howard, with his family, passed the
third day with them.&nbsp; Towards evening, they all ascended the
hill.&nbsp; Mr. Draper was struck with the extensive view, and
the beauty of his wife&rsquo;s domain, for he scrupulously called
it her own.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a waste of water!&rdquo; he
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a noble run for mills and
manufactories!&rdquo;&nbsp; Poor Frances actually turned pale;
but, collecting her spirits, she said, &ldquo;It is hardly right
to call it a <i>waste</i> of water.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Liberal, not lavish, is kind Nature&rsquo;s
hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the mean time, Mr. Draper had taken his pencil, and on the
back of a letter was making lines and dashes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look
here,&rdquo; said he to Howard.&nbsp; &ldquo;See how perfectly
this natural ledge <!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 44</span>of rocks may be converted into a dam:
it seems precisely made for it: then, by digging a canal to
conduct the water a little to the left, there is a fine site for
a cotton-manufactory, which, built of granite, would add much to
the beauty of the prospect.&nbsp; Just here, where that old tree
is thrown across the stream, a bridge may be built, in the form
of an arch, which also must be of stone.&nbsp; It will make the
view altogether perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot think,&rdquo; said Howard, &ldquo;the view
would be improved; you would have a great stone building, with
its countless windows and abutments, but you would lose the
still, tranquil effect of the prospect, and take much from the
beauty of the stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I shall manage it,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sure Frances herself will agree with me that it adds
fifty per cent. to the beauty of the prospect when she sees it
completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In vain Frances protested she was satisfied with it as it was;
the month that she had hoped was to be given to leisure was one
of the busiest of her husband&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; Contracts were
made&mdash;an association formed.&nbsp; Mr. Draper <!-- page
45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>was
continually driving to the city, and mechanics were passing to
and fro.&nbsp; Clyde Farm began to wear the appearance of a
business place.&nbsp; A manufacturing company was incorporated
under the title of the Clyde Mills.&nbsp; The stillness of the
spot was exchanged for the strokes of the pickaxe, the human
voice urging on oxen and horses, the blasting of rocks; the grass
was trampled down, the trees were often wantonly injured, and,
where they obstructed the tracks of wheels, laid prostrate.&nbsp;
Frances no longer delighted to walk at noon day under the thick
foliage that threw its shadow on the grass as vividly as a
painting.&nbsp; All was changed!&nbsp; It is true she now saw her
husband, but she had but little more of his society; his mind and
time were wholly engrossed; he came often, and certainly did not,
as formerly, confine his visits to the Sabbath.</p>
<p>All went on with wonderful rapidity; story rose upon story,
till it seemed as if the new manufactory, with its windows and
abutments, was destined to become another Babel.&nbsp; When
Charlotte came to Clyde, she gazed with astonishment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All this,&rdquo; said she to Howard, <!-- page 46--><a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>&ldquo;is the
project of a speculator!&nbsp; Grown men now-a-days remind me of
the story of the boy who planted his bean at night, and went out
in the morning to see how it grew; he found it had nearly reached
the chamber windows; he went out the next morning, and it was up
to the eaves of the house; on the third morning, it had shot up
to the clouds, and he descried a castle, or a manufactory, I
don&rsquo;t know which, on the top of it.&nbsp; Then it was high
time to scale it; so up, up, he went, and when he arrived at the
building, he put his foot into it, and then he perceived it was
made of vapor; and down came bean, castle, and boy, headlong, in
<i>three seconds</i>, though it had taken <i>three whole days</i>
to complete the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must tell your story to my brother,&rdquo; said
Howard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Charlotte; &ldquo;he would not
profit by it; but I will tell it to my children, and teach them
to train their beans in the good old-fashioned way, near the
ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus passed the autumn at Clyde; that period which every
reflecting mind enjoys as a season of contemplation; that period
when our <!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 47</span>New England woods assume every
variety of color, and shine forth with a splendor that indicates
decay.&nbsp; Still the two families had much enjoyment together;
the health of Frances and little Charlotte had decidedly
improved; but when the leaves began to fall, and the wind to
whistle through the branches, they quitted Clyde and returned to
the city.&nbsp; Their new house was not ready for them, and they
were obliged to take lodgings at one of the hotels.</p>
<p>Mr. Draper met Dr. B., their friend and physician, in his
walks, and begged him to call and see his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
rejoice to say,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that her health does not
require any medical advice; she is quite well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Probably Dr. B. thought otherwise, for he suggested the
advantage that both she and the little girl might derive from
passing the winter in a warm climate.&nbsp; Never was there a
fairer opportunity; they had no home to quit, and their residence
at a hotel was one of necessity, not of choice.&nbsp; But Mr.
Draper said it was quite impossible.&nbsp; What! leave his
counting-room, State Street, India Wharf, the insurance offices!
leave all in the full tide of speculation, <!-- page 48--><a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>when he was
near the El Dorado for which he had so long been toiling! when
Eastern lands and Western lands, rail-roads and steam-boats,
cotton, and manufactories, were in all their glory; when his own
Clyde Mills were just going into operation!&nbsp; It was
impossible, wholly impossible; and Frances would not go without
him.&nbsp; The suggestion was given up, and she remained in the
city almost wholly confined to the atmosphere of a small room
with a coal fire.&nbsp; Unfortunately the measles appeared among
the children at the hotel, and Mrs. Draper&rsquo;s were taken
sick before she knew that the epidemic was there.&nbsp; They had
the best attendance, but nothing supersedes a mother&rsquo;s
devotion.&nbsp; Frances passed many a sleepless night in watching
over them.&nbsp; With the eldest the disorder proved slight, but
it was otherwise with the youngest; and when she began to grow
better, the mother drooped.&nbsp; It was a dreary winter for poor
Mrs. Draper, but not so for her husband.&nbsp; Never had there
been a season of such profits, such glorious speculations!&nbsp;
Some <i>croakers</i> said it could not last; and some of our
gifted statesmen predicted that <!-- page 49--><a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>an
overwhelming blow must inevitably come.&nbsp; But all this was
nothing to speculators; it certainly would not arrive till after
<i>they</i> had made their millions.</p>
<p>Spring approached, with its uncertainty of climate; sometimes,
the streets were in rivers, and the next day frozen in masses;
then came volumes of east wind.&nbsp; Mrs. Draper&rsquo;s cough
returned more frequently than ever, and Charlotte looked too
frail for earth.&nbsp; The physician informed Mr. Draper that he
considered it positively necessary to remove the invalids to a
milder climate, and mentioned Cuba.&nbsp; Mr. Draper, however,
decided that an inland journey would be best, and, inconvenient
as it was, determined to travel as far as some of the
<i>cotton-growing</i> states.&nbsp; After the usual busy
preparations, they set off, the wife fully realizing that she was
blighting in the bud her husband&rsquo;s projected speculations
for a few weeks to come, and feeling that he was making what he
considered great sacrifices.</p>
<p>Almost all invalids who have travelled on our continent in
pursuit of uniformity of climate, have been disappointed.&nbsp;
At <!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>New York they were detained a week by a flight of snow
and rain, shut up in dreary rooms; then came a glimmering of
sunshine, and Philadelphia looked bright and serene; but at
Baltimore the rain again descended.&nbsp; They were so near
Washington, Mr. Draper thought it best to hurry on, with every
precaution for the invalids.&nbsp; At Washington, they found the
straw mattings had superseded woollen carpets, and the
fire-places were ornamented with green branches.&nbsp; They
continued their journey south till they at length arrived at
Charleston.&nbsp; Here they found a milder climate, and a few
days of sunshine.&nbsp; Mr. Draper was no longer restless; he had
full employment in shipping cargoes of cotton, and making
bargains, not only for what was in the market, but for a
proportion of that which was yet to grow, as confidently as if he
had previously secured the rain and sunshine of heaven.&nbsp;
There is a constant change of weather on our coast&mdash;another
storm came on.&nbsp; The little invalid evidently lost rather
than gained.&nbsp; Discouraged and disheartened, Frances begged
they might return.&nbsp; &ldquo;One week at <!-- page 51--><a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>Clyde, where
they might have the comforts of home, would do more for
them,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;than all this fruitless search for
a favorable climate.&rdquo;&nbsp; When Mr. Draper had completed
his bargains, he was equally desirous to return to the city, and
at the end of a tedious journey, over bad roads in some parts of
it, rail-roads in others, and a tremendous blow round Point
Judith, the travellers arrived at Boston on one of those raw,
piercing, misty days, that seemed to have been accumulating fogs
for their reception.&nbsp; The physician hastened their departure
to Clyde, as it was inland and sheltered from the sea.&nbsp; This
removal was made, and then they had nothing to do but to get
well.&nbsp; Howard and Charlotte were rejoiced at the reunion,
and the feeble little invalid tried to resume her former sports
with her cousins.&nbsp; But all would not answer, and when June
came on, with its season of roses, she slept at the foot of the
mount.&nbsp; It was a retired spot that the mother selected for
the remains, and only a temporary one, for they were to be
removed to Mount Auburn at the close of autumn.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>It were well if we could receive the events of
Providence in the sublime simplicity with which they come, but
the sensitive and tender-hearted often add to their poignancy by
useless self-reproach.&nbsp; Frances thought the journey had,
perhaps, been the cause of the child&rsquo;s untimely death, and
lamented that she had not opposed a measure which she had
undertaken solely for its benefit.&nbsp; The death of friends is
a calamity that few have not strength enough to bear, if they do
not exaggerate their sufferings, by imagining that something was
done, or left undone, for which they were responsible.&nbsp; To
this nervous state of feeling Frances was peculiarly liable, from
her ill health; and it was many weeks before her excellent powers
of mind obtained full exercise.&nbsp; Yet they finally triumphed,
and she became first resigned, then cheerful.&nbsp; The sorrow of
the father was of a different character, and exhausted itself in
proportion to its violence.&nbsp; It was followed by new projects
and new anticipations; the manufactory had succeeded beyond his
most sanguine expectations.&nbsp; A discovery had been made that
enabled <!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>them to afford their cloth a cent per
yard cheaper than any other manufacturing establishment.&nbsp;
Bales of cotton poured in upon him from the south, and ships
arrived from various parts of the world.&nbsp; How could he find
time for grief!</p>
<h2><!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p>The first visit Frances made to the lake after her return,
discovered to her, that it was sadly changed.&nbsp; It was no
longer full to overflowing, but swampy and low; the water was
constantly drained off to supply the manufactory and mills which
were erected at a distance.&nbsp; Mr. Draper had found out that
the little stream could much more than earn its own living, and
it was made to work hard.&nbsp; One thing, however, was wanting
to complete his Clyde speculations, and that was a
rail-road.&nbsp; This had now become necessary.&nbsp; Every thing
afforded the greatest facility for it.&nbsp; Laborers could be
procured from the village and farms in the vicinity.&nbsp; Yet
how could he reconcile his wife to it?&nbsp; The road must pass
through the hill, and near the house.&nbsp; He was aware that it
would destroy the rural beauty of the place; but what an increase
of wealth it would be! what a princely revenue! what a spirit of
business <!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>and speculation it would spread
through the country!&nbsp; Every man would be able not only to
make the most of his capital, but to get credit to ten times its
real amount.&nbsp; He considered it a public benefit, and he was
imperiously called to accomplish it; and so he stated the matter
to his wife with as much tenderness towards her feelings as the
case would admit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hoped,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that the sum of your
public benefits was completed by our sacrifice in the
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not spoken with your usual generous feeling,
Frances,&rdquo; replied he.&nbsp; &ldquo;When are patriotic
exertions to cease?&nbsp; Are we not called upon to be constantly
making them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard would say it is injuring the cause of the
country to turn agriculturists into speculators,&rdquo; said
Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Howard is an excellent man,&rdquo; replied Mr. Draper;
&ldquo;he is born to be a farmer, and nothing else.&nbsp; I have
no wish to change his vocation; he dignifies it by uniting
intelligence with manual labor; but there are many who are
toiling merely for money, and they can get much more by my method
than his.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Will their happiness be increased?&rdquo; said
Mrs. Draper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, inasmuch as wealth procures the means of
happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have <i>you</i> found it so?&rdquo; again asked
Frances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not precisely.&nbsp; I am still toiling; my season for
rest and enjoyment has not arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;Howard is <i>rich
enough</i> for enjoyment.&nbsp; You have already a great estate;
let me ask, what advantage you derive from it beyond your daily
meals?&nbsp; You take care of this immense property; you are
continually increasing it, and all the compensation you get is a
<i>bare living</i>.&nbsp; Would any of the clerks you employ in
your counting-room labor for such low wages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Frances,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper,
affectionately, &ldquo;I am always contented to admire your
ingenuity without combating your arguments.&nbsp; Perhaps it
might be better, if you had cultivated a little more of the
<i>rationale</i> of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied she, languidly smiling, &ldquo;I
am going to prove to you, that I have profited <!-- page 57--><a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>by your
example, and am becoming a business wife.&nbsp; You call this
farm <i>mine</i>, and tell me you bought it for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly; all I have is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I claim no title to any thing but this; but this I
consider your gift, and as such accept it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Draper certainly did not look delighted at this unexpected
statement, and began to tremble for his rail-road; but he
remained silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have undoubtedly greatly increased the actual value
of Clyde Farm, by mills and manufactories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I have; but all is in a manner useless
without the rail-road as a means of transportation: that will put
every thing into complete operation, and make the revenue
princely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;I can have no
hesitation in making my offer.&nbsp; I will sell this place to
you for what you gave for it.&nbsp; Secure the sum to me
outright, and I renounce my title to Clyde Farm.&nbsp; Make it,
if you please, <!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>wholly a manufacturing place; do not
consult me whether there shall be rail-roads or mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, &ldquo;with an
estate like mine, I should be mortified to make such a paltry
purchase of my wife.&nbsp; It is for you and our only child that
I am accumulating a fortune.&nbsp; Have you ever found me sordid
or tenacious of money, that you wish a certain sum secured to
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; said she with emotion; &ldquo;all that
money can purchase, you have been most liberal in procuring
me.&nbsp; Would that you were as generous to yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have our own ideas of happiness,&rdquo; said Mr.
Draper; &ldquo;but since it is your wish, Frances, I will close
with your proposal, and secure to you twenty thousand dollars,
which is a little more than I paid for Clyde Farm.&nbsp; Legal
instruments shall be immediately drawn up; and to convince you
that I wish for no control over that sum, I will have it put in
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the instrument be so worded,&rdquo; said <!-- page
59--><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>Frances, &ldquo;that it shall revert to our child at my
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper, coldly;
&ldquo;it is all the same to me.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>CHAPTER V.&mdash;CONCLUSION.</h2>
<p>From this time, Clyde Farm became wholly a place of
business.&nbsp; No regard was now paid to the beauty of the
place.&nbsp; Iron-manufactories, nail-manufactories, and
saw-mills, were projected, and all was hurry and bustle.&nbsp;
One more pang, however, remained for Frances.&nbsp; The
sequestered nook she had selected, where her little
Charlotte&rsquo;s remains were deposited,&mdash;that spot, so
still, so tranquil, so shaded by trees, and so sheltered by
valleys, so removed apparently from the tumult of
business,&mdash;over that very spot, it was found necessary for
the rail-road to pass!&nbsp; Strange as it may seem, the worldly
father appeared to feel more deeply this innovation than the
mother.</p>
<p>Twice he repaired to the spot to give his directions for the
removal of the remains, and twice an impetuous burst of sorrow
drove him from it.</p>
<p><!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;It is only a temporary resting-place, even for
the body,&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;the spirit is not
there.&rdquo;&nbsp; She looked calmly on, and gave those
directions for which the father was unable.</p>
<p>Another winter was now advancing, and the house in the city
was ready for occupancy.&nbsp; Mrs. Draper made her preparations
to return, but they were often interrupted by a pain in her
side.&nbsp; The cough had entirely changed its character; it was
now deep and hollow.&nbsp; She certainly looked remarkably well;
her complexion seemed to have recovered the delicacy and
transparency of early youth, and her eyes their lustrous
brightness.&nbsp; As for the color of her cheek, her husband
sometimes playfully accused her of extracting rouge from her
carnations.</p>
<p>Charlotte spoke to him doubtingly of his wife&rsquo;s health,
and Lucy said she &ldquo;was afraid she would not stand the
frosty nights when they came on.&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Draper was
sanguine that Clyde had been her restoration.</p>
<p>When she arrived at the city, there were arrangements to be
made, and new furniture to be procured.&nbsp; Her husband gave
her full permission <!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>to do just as she pleased, only
begged of her not to call upon him, for he had not one moment to
spare.</p>
<p>Frances exerted all her strength, but it became evident that
she drooped.&nbsp; Her nights were restless; and though some
thought it encouraging, that she coughed so much <i>stronger</i>,
it was exhausting to her frame.</p>
<p>Mr. Draper at length perceived that she had rather lost than
gained; he went for her physician, and requested him to recommend
quiet to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;she
has over-fatigued herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. B. came to see her, conversed with her, counted the
throbbings of her pulse, and made a minute examination of her
case.&nbsp; The conference was long; when he entered the parlor,
he found Mr. Draper waiting.&nbsp; He received him with a smile;
but there was no responsive smile on the doctor&rsquo;s face; it
was solemn and thoughtful.</p>
<p>Mr. Draper grew alarmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not think my wife
very sick, I hope,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her cough is
troublesome; but you know she has long been subject to it.&nbsp;
Indeed, I think <!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>it is constitutional, like my
own.&nbsp; You recommended the white mixture to her last year: it
did her good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recommended a voyage and a warm climate,&rdquo; said
the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember you did; but it was impossible for me
to go away then.&nbsp; In the spring we took that unlucky
journey; however, it was of benefit to her, and if you think it
necessary, I will go the same route now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not,&rdquo; replied Dr. B.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of it; it would be particularly inconvenient
to me just now to leave the city.&nbsp; Times are perplexing:
bills come back protested&mdash;bad news from
England&mdash;sudden and unlooked-for failures&mdash;no one can
tell where it will end.&nbsp; We have been obliged to stop our
works at Clyde Farm, and there are from ninety to a hundred
laborers thrown out of employment.&nbsp; This is peculiarly
vexatious to me, as they made out before to earn a living in
their own <i>humdrum</i> way, and they now accuse me of having
taken the bread from their children&rsquo;s mouths, to promote my
own speculations, though, while I employed them, I gave <!-- page
64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>them
enormous wages.&nbsp; But this, sir, is the gratitude of the
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor still remained silent.&nbsp; It seemed as if Mr.
Draper began to tremble for something dearer than money, for he
grasped the hand of the physician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not think my wife dangerously ill, I
trust,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The doctor replied, in a low voice, &ldquo;I fear she
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Draper; &ldquo;she was
remarkably well when we left Clyde.&nbsp; But what do you
prescribe?&nbsp; I will do any thing, every thing, say but the
word.&nbsp; I will take her to Europe&mdash;I will go to any part
of the world you recommend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear doctor, you must go with us.&nbsp; I will
indemnify you a thousand times for all losses; you can save her
life; you know her constitution.&nbsp; When shall we go? and
where?&nbsp; I will charter a vessel; we can be off in three
days;&rdquo;&mdash;and he actually took his hat.</p>
<p>Dr. B. said impressively, &ldquo;Pray be seated, and prepare
yourself to hear, like a man, what <!-- page 65--><a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>you must
inevitably learn.&nbsp; It will not answer any useful purpose to
go to a milder climate; it is now too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not mean to say,&rdquo; said Mr. Draper,
impetuously, &ldquo;that if she had gone last year she would have
been restored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I do not mean to say that; but then, there would
have been a chance; now, there is none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you not tell me so, sir?&rdquo; said Mr.
Draper, angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said all that I was authorized to say.&nbsp; When I
urged the step as necessary, you replied that it was
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too true!&rdquo; exclaimed he, striking his
forehead; &ldquo;and yet she is dearer to me than my own
life;&rdquo;&mdash;and, unable to suppress his feelings, he burst
into an agony of tears.&nbsp; Suddenly starting up, he said,
&ldquo;Doctor, I have the highest respect for your skill; but you
are fallible, like all men.&nbsp; It is my opinion, that a sea
voyage and change of climate will restore my wife.&nbsp; If you
will go with us, so much the better; if not, I will seek some
other physician to accompany her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>&ldquo;It is but right to inform you,&rdquo; said Dr.
B., &ldquo;that there is no chance of restoration.&nbsp; I
suggested to her, that there might be alleviation in a warm
climate; but she positively declines seeking it, and says her
only wish is to die quietly, at home.&nbsp; She fully estimates
the strength of your affection, and entreats of you to spare her
all superfluous agitation.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tell him,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;there is but one thing that can unsettle the calmness
of my mind; it is to see him wanting in Christian
resignation.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be painful to dwell on the anguish that followed this
communication.&nbsp; Mr. Draper realized, for the first time, the
tenderness and watchfulness that a character and constitution
like his wife&rsquo;s required.&nbsp; In the common acceptation
of the word, he was an excellent husband; yet, in his eager
pursuit of wealth, he had left her to struggle alone with many of
the harassing cares of life.&nbsp; He had, by thinking himself
unable to accompany her, denied her the necessary recreation of
travelling; he had deprived her of her favorite residence in the
city, and when she turned her affections to Clyde, even there
they found no resting-place.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>He recollected their unpropitious journey&mdash;the
exposure to cold and rain&mdash;that he had hurried on the
invalids, till he had accomplished his own purposes.&nbsp; One
had already gone; the other was fast following.&nbsp; Speculators
have consciences and affections, and his were roused to
agony.</p>
<p>Frances shrunk not from the hour of death, which rapidly
approached.&nbsp; Howard and Charlotte were constantly with
her.&nbsp; There was nothing gloomy in her views.&nbsp; She
considered this life as a passage to another; and saw through the
vista immortality and happiness.&nbsp; To Charlotte, she
bequeathed her daughter, and this faithful friend promised to
watch over her with a mother&rsquo;s care.</p>
<p>Many and long were her conversations with her
husband&mdash;not on the subject of her death, or arrangements
after it should take place; but she was earnest that her
serenity, her high hopes, might be transferred to his mind.&nbsp;
She had often, in the overflowings of her heart, endeavored to
communicate to him her animated convictions of a future
life.&nbsp; Those who live constantly in the present think but
little of the <!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>future.&nbsp; Mr. Draper usually cut
short the conversation, with the apparently devout
sentiment,&mdash;&ldquo;I am quite satisfied on this subject;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Whatever is, is right.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, however, when he realized that the being he most tenderly
loved was fast retreating from his view, he felt that there was a
vast difference between the reasonings of philosophy and the
revelations of Christianity; and, in the agony of his soul, he
would have given worlds for the assurance of a reunion.&nbsp; On
this subject Frances dwelt; and he now listened patiently,
without once looking at his watch, or being seized with one of
his paroxysms of coughing.&nbsp; Still, however, he doubted; for
how could he trust without <i>bonds</i> and
<i>contracts</i>?&nbsp; No one had come back to tell him
<i>individually</i> the whole truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I acknowledge,&rdquo; said he, somewhat reproachfully,
&ldquo;that this conviction is earnestly to be desired.&nbsp; If
saves you from the agony that at this moment rends my
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; replied Frances, in a voice
interrupted by deep and solemn emotion, <!-- page 69--><a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;religion is not given us for an opiate to be used
at a last extremity, merely to lull the sense of pain.&nbsp; The
views I express are not new to me; they have been for many years
my daily food; they have supported me through hours of bodily
anguish; . . . the human frame does not decay as gradually as
mine without repeated warnings; . . . they will conduct me
through the dark valley of death, when I can no longer lean upon
your arm . . . Their efficacy does not merely consist in soothing
the bitterness of parting; they have a health giving energy that
infuses courage and fortitude amidst the disappointments and
evils of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henceforth,&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Draper,&mdash;and at
that moment he was sincere,&mdash;&ldquo;every thing of a worldly
nature is indifferent to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All men,&rdquo; continued Frances, without replying to
his exclamation, &ldquo;are subject to the reverses of life, but
particularly men of extensive business connections.&nbsp; They
are like the spider in his cobweb dwelling; touch but one of the
thousand filaments that compose it, and it vibrates to the
centre, and often the fabric is destroyed that has been so
skilfully woven.&nbsp; There is a divine teaching in religion,
which at <!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>such times restores equanimity to the
mind, gives new aspirations, and proves that all in this life is
not lost, and nothing for that to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>New scenes were opening upon Mr. Draper.&nbsp; It became
evident that a dark cloud hung over the business
atmosphere.&nbsp; Unexpected failures every day took place.&nbsp;
Some attributed the thick-coming evils to the removal of the
deposits, others to interrupted currency; some to overtrading,
and some to extravagance.&nbsp; Whatever was the cause, the
distress was real.&nbsp; Mr. Draper&rsquo;s cotton became a drug
in the market; manufactories stopped, or gave no dividends.&nbsp;
Eastern lands lost even their nominal value, and western towns
became bankrupt.&nbsp; Ships stood in the harbor, with their
sails unbent and masts dismantled.&nbsp; Day laborers looked
aghast, not knowing where to earn food for their families.&nbsp;
The whirlwind came; it made no distinction of persons.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It smote the four corners of the house,&rdquo; and the
high-minded and honorable fell indiscriminately with the
rest.&nbsp; Well may it be asked, Whence came this desolation
upon the community?&nbsp; No pestilence visited our land; it <!--
page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>was not the plague; it was not the yellow fever, or
cholera.&nbsp; Health was borne on every breeze; the earth
yielded her produce, and Peace still dwelt among us.</p>
<p>Mr. Draper felt as if &ldquo;his mountain stood strong,&rdquo;
yet it began to totter.&nbsp; Frances was ignorant of the state
of public affairs.&nbsp; Who would intrude the perplexities of
the times into a dying chamber?&nbsp; Softly and gently she sank
to rest, her last look of affection beaming upon her husband.</p>
<p>The next morning, the bankruptcy of Mr. Draper was
announced.&nbsp; No blame was attached to him, though the sum for
which he became insolvent was immense, and swallowed up many a
hard-earned fortune.&nbsp; Where was Howard&rsquo;s little
capital?&mdash;Gone with the rest&mdash;principal and <i>compound
interest</i>!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a ruined man!&rdquo; said Mr. Draper to Howard;
&ldquo;I have robbed you, and beggared my child; but one resource
remains to me;&rdquo;&mdash;and he looked around with the
desperation of insanity.</p>
<p>Howard grasped his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear brother,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;your wife, with an almost <!-- page 72--><a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>prophetic
spirit, foresaw this hour.&nbsp; &lsquo;Comfort him,&rsquo; said
she, &lsquo;when it arrives, and lead his mind to higher
objects.&rsquo;&nbsp; Your child has an ample provision, by the
sum settled on her mother.&nbsp; I have lost property which I did
not use, and, with the blessing of God, may never want.&nbsp;
Come home with me; I have means for us both.&nbsp; You will have
all the indulgences you ever coveted.&nbsp; No one has led a
harder life than you have.&nbsp; You have labored like the
galley-slave, without wages; come, and learn that, beyond what we
can use for our own or others&rsquo; benefit, wealth has only an
imaginary value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was an additional mortification to Mr. Draper, to
find that, a few days after his failure, the banks concluded to
issue no specie.&nbsp; Many were kept along by this resolution;
while others stopped, with the conviction, that, had they been
contented with moderate gains, they might, in this day of trouble
and perplexity, have been <span class="smcap">rich
enough</span>.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
